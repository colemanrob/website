      <description>The 2016 Census has a lot of useful data to be examined. Luckily, there&amp;rsquo;s a great R package cancensus that let&amp;rsquo;s you access and map the data easily.
You can use get_census to download the table and geographic features you need.
sault_income &amp;lt;- get_census(dataset=&#39;CA16&#39;, regions=list(CMA=&amp;quot;35590&amp;quot;), vectors=&amp;quot;v_CA16_2397&amp;quot;, level=&#39;DA&#39;, quiet = TRUE, geo_format = &#39;sf&#39;, labels = &#39;short&#39;)  The dataframe is ready to be mapped using ggplot or leaflet if you want to be interactive.</description>

      <description>Algoma Public Health is the public health agency in my area that inspects restaurants to ensure they are abiding by all the relevant food safety legislation. They are also nice enough to publish their restaurant health inspection reports online for anyone to review.
I searched for a few restaurants that I frequent (phew Fratellis is safe!) but then I wanted to know which restaurants had the most health infractions?</description>

      <description>At work, I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for a list of National Occupation Codes and their descriptions. I realized I can probably scrape this information faster than I can find it on my team&amp;rsquo;s network drive thanks to rvest and the tidyverse.
Libraries:
library(tidyverse) # make tidy library(rvest) # scrape data library(knitr) # make a table  Read in the appropriate list of NOCs:
