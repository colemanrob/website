      <description>Sources  Student&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Bayesian Statisitcs, Ben Lambert  Part 1 Statisitical Inference  sometimes we know the process that generates data (e.g. coin-flip) and so calculating probability is straightforward. when we don&amp;rsquo;t have perfect knowledge of the process; it is the goal of statistical inference to derive estimates of unknown characteristics or parameters of these data-generating mechanisms. Bayesians start with what is known - the data - and make probabilistic assumptions about the underlying process that generates the data.</description>

      <description>Robot Proof: Higher Education in the age of Artificial Intelligence
Joseph E. Anoun
 A short but well written glimpse into how higher ed will have to adapt given the progress of artificial intelligence and its impact on human work. Anoun mostly follows Harari on the transition of human work but is more an optimist insofar as he thinks there will still be a role for humans alongside machines in the labour market.</description>
