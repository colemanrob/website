      <description>I was inspired by David Robinson&amp;rsquo;s latest webcast in which he made a heatmap of French train delays using geom_tile and wanted to try it out for myself.
 In this week&amp;#39;s #tidytuesday screencast, I analyze delays in French train stations ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·ðŸš„
I show how to create heatmaps of delays (inspired by @noccaea!), and embarrass myself with even the simplest French pronunciationshttps://t.co/zBrkIkdcCz #rstats pic.twitter.com/RI7ZpxV89X

      <description>I covered some interesting changes to minimum wage in my last post. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to build my skills in the mapping department, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to create an interactive map of the communities most affected by the change in minimum wage.
Loading the data The wage data is collected by the Canadian federal government and published as an open dataset available for download. The data is geographically organized by economic region, so we&amp;rsquo;ll need the shapefile for those boundaries which is also published as an open dataset!</description>

      <title>Minimum Wage Changes in Ontario</title>

      <description>Ontario has recently made changes to the minimum wage and many didn&amp;rsquo;t react calmly. I thought it might be interesting to see what kinds of occupations will be affected by the changes. Thankfully, the federal government posted a dataset on wages that helps answer some questions.
Exploring the data We can use the dataset to find out which occupations have a median wage of less than $14/hr. I&amp;rsquo;m particularly interested in my neck of the woods, Northern Ontario.</description>

      <description>The 2016 Census has a lot of useful data to be examined. Luckily, there&amp;rsquo;s a great R package cancensus that let&amp;rsquo;s you access and map the data easily.
You can use get_census to download the table and geographic features you need.
sault_income &amp;lt;- get_census(dataset=&amp;#39;CA16&amp;#39;, regions=list(CMA=&amp;#34;35590&amp;#34;), vectors=&amp;#34;v_CA16_2397&amp;#34;, level=&amp;#39;DA&amp;#39;, quiet = TRUE, geo_format = &amp;#39;sf&amp;#39;, labels = &amp;#39;short&amp;#39;) The dataframe is ready to be mapped using ggplot or leaflet if you want to be interactive.</description>
